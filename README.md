# 👋 Hi, I'm Kenny Wang

I'm currently a Software Intern at **Neural Craft Labs (NCL)**, where I focus on building and experimenting with local LLM-powered applications.

---

## 🧠 Projects I'm Working On

- 🔍 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) App**  
  Built a fully local RAG app using:
  - `LangChain` for orchestration
  - `FAISS` for vector search
  - `Ollama` (e.g. Mistral) for running LLMs locally
  - `Streamlit` for a lightweight UI

- 💻 Exploring secure, API-free deployment for internal tools
- 🧪 Working with document loaders, embeddings, and conversational pipelines

## ⚙️ Tech I'm Using

`Python` • `LangChain` • `Streamlit` • `FAISS` • `Ollama` • `VS Code` • `Git`
